## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Query Optimization with EXPLAIN

**Step 1: Analyze EXPLAIN Plan (PostgreSQL)**

```sql
-- EXPLAIN shows query plan
EXPLAIN
SELECT u.name, o.total
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE o.created_at > '2024-01-01';

-- EXPLAIN ANALYZE executes and shows actual timings
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT u.name, o.total
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE o.created_at > '2024-01-01';
```

**Key Metrics to Check**:
- **Seq Scan** (bad): Full table scan, add index
- **Index Scan** (good): Using index
- **Bitmap Index Scan** (good): Efficient for multiple conditions
- **Nested Loop** (watch out): Can be slow for large datasets
- **Hash Join** (usually good): Efficient join method
- **Cost**: Estimated cost (lower is better)
- **Actual time**: Real execution time

**Step 2: Create Optimal Index**

```sql
-- ❌ SLOW: No index on created_at
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01';

-- ✅ FAST: Create index
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_created_at ON orders (created_at);

-- ✅ COMPOUND INDEX: For multiple columns
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_created
ON orders (user_id, created_at);

-- ✅ PARTIAL INDEX: For filtered queries
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_pending
ON orders (created_at)
WHERE status = 'pending';

-- ✅ COVERING INDEX: Include frequently queried columns
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_covering
ON orders (user_id, created_at)
INCLUDE (total, status);
```

**Step 3: Rewrite Query for Performance**

```sql
-- ❌ SLOW: N+1 query pattern
SELECT id, name FROM users;
-- Then for each user:
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?;

-- ✅ FAST: Single query with JOIN
SELECT u.id, u.name, o.*
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;

-- ❌ SLOW: NOT IN with subquery
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT user_id FROM orders);

-- ✅ FAST: LEFT JOIN with NULL check
SELECT u.*
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE o.user_id IS NULL;

-- ❌ SLOW: OR conditions prevent index use
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE user_id = 123 OR status = 'pending';

-- ✅ FAST: UNION ALL with indexes
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = 123
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending' AND user_id != 123;
```

### Workflow 2: Table Partitioning (PostgreSQL)

**Step 1: Create Partitioned Table**

```sql
-- Range partitioning by date
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id BIGSERIAL,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  created_at DATE NOT NULL,
  total DECIMAL(10, 2),
  status VARCHAR(20)
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Create partitions
CREATE TABLE orders_2024_q1 PARTITION OF orders
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-04-01');

CREATE TABLE orders_2024_q2 PARTITION OF orders
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-04-01') TO ('2024-07-01');

-- Create index on each partition
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_2024_q1_user_id
ON orders_2024_q1 (user_id);

-- Queries automatically use correct partition
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE created_at >= '2024-02-01'
  AND created_at < '2024-03-01';
-- Only scans orders_2024_q1 partition
```

**Step 2: List Partitioning by Status**

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders_by_status (
  id BIGSERIAL,
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  -- ... other columns
) PARTITION BY LIST (status);

CREATE TABLE orders_pending PARTITION OF orders_by_status
FOR VALUES IN ('pending', 'processing');

CREATE TABLE orders_completed PARTITION OF orders_by_status
FOR VALUES IN ('completed', 'shipped');
```

### Workflow 3: PostgreSQL-Specific Optimizations

**Step 1: JSONB Queries with GIN Index**

```sql
-- JSONB column for flexible data
CREATE TABLE events (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  data JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- GIN index for JSONB containment queries
CREATE INDEX idx_events_data_gin ON events USING GIN (data);

-- Query JSONB efficiently
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE data @> '{"user_id": 123}';

SELECT * FROM events
WHERE data -> 'metadata' ->> 'source' = 'web';

-- Extract and index specific JSONB field
CREATE INDEX idx_events_user_id
ON events ((data->>'user_id'));
```

**Step 2: Full-Text Search**

```sql
-- Add tsvector column
ALTER TABLE articles
ADD COLUMN search_vector tsvector;

-- Populate tsvector
UPDATE articles
SET search_vector = to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || content);

-- Create GIN index for full-text search
CREATE INDEX idx_articles_search
ON articles USING GIN (search_vector);

-- Search query
SELECT * FROM articles
WHERE search_vector @@ to_tsquery('english', 'database & optimization');

-- Trigger to auto-update search_vector
CREATE TRIGGER articles_search_update
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON articles
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION
  tsvector_update_trigger(search_vector, 'pg_catalog.english', title, content);
```

**Step 3: Vacuum and Maintenance**

```sql
-- Manual VACUUM to reclaim space
VACUUM VERBOSE ANALYZE orders;

-- VACUUM FULL for maximum space reclamation (locks table)
VACUUM FULL orders;

-- Auto-vacuum settings (postgresql.conf)
autovacuum = on
autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.1  -- Vacuum when 10% of rows change
autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.05

-- Monitor bloat
SELECT schemaname, tablename,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size,
  n_live_tup, n_dead_tup
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;
```

### Workflow 4: Connection Pooling

**PostgreSQL with PgBouncer**

```ini
# pgbouncer.ini
[databases]
mydb = host=localhost dbname=mydb

[pgbouncer]
listen_addr = 0.0.0.0
listen_port = 6432
auth_type = md5
auth_file = /etc/pgbouncer/userlist.txt
pool_mode = transaction  # or session, statement
max_client_conn = 1000
default_pool_size = 25
```

**Node.js with pg-pool**

```javascript
const { Pool } = require('pg');

const pool = new Pool({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 5432,
  database: 'mydb',
  user: 'dbuser',
  password: 'password',
  max: 20,  // Max connections in pool
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
});

// Query with automatic connection management
const result = await pool.query(
  'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1',
  [userId]
);

// Transaction
const client = await pool.connect();
try {
  await client.query('BEGIN');
  await client.query('UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - $1 WHERE id = $2', [100, 1]);
  await client.query('UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + $1 WHERE id = $2', [100, 2]);
  await client.query('COMMIT');
} catch (e) {
  await client.query('ROLLBACK');
  throw e;
} finally {
  client.release();
}
```

### Workflow 5: Zero-Downtime Migration

```sql
-- Step 1: Add new column (non-blocking)
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

-- Step 2: Backfill data in batches
DO $$
DECLARE
  batch_size INT := 1000;
  last_id INT := 0;
BEGIN
  LOOP
    UPDATE users
    SET email_verified = (email IS NOT NULL AND email != '')
    WHERE id > last_id AND id <= last_id + batch_size;

    EXIT WHEN NOT FOUND;
    last_id := last_id + batch_size;
    COMMIT;  -- Commit each batch
    PERFORM pg_sleep(0.1);  -- Pause to reduce load
  END LOOP;
END $$;

-- Step 3: Add NOT NULL constraint (after backfill)
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN email_verified SET NOT NULL;
```

## Best Practices

**1. Always Use Parameterized Queries**
```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Prevents SQL injection
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1;

-- ❌ BAD: SQL injection vulnerability
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ' + userId + ';
```

**2. Index Foreign Keys**
```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Index foreign keys for JOIN performance
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders (user_id);
```

**3. Use Appropriate Data Types**
```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Efficient data types
CREATE TABLE users (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  age SMALLINT,
  balance DECIMAL(10, 2),
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);

-- ❌ BAD: Wasteful data types
CREATE TABLE users (
  id VARCHAR(255),  -- Should be BIGSERIAL
  age INT,  -- Should be SMALLINT
  balance FLOAT  -- Should be DECIMAL for money
);
```

**4. Limit Large Result Sets**
```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Pagination with LIMIT/OFFSET
SELECT * FROM orders
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20 OFFSET 0;

-- Better: Cursor-based pagination
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE id > last_seen_id
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 20;
```

**5. Monitor Query Performance**
```sql
-- Enable pg_stat_statements (PostgreSQL)
CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;

-- Find slow queries
SELECT
  query,
  calls,
  total_exec_time / 1000 AS total_seconds,
  mean_exec_time / 1000 AS mean_seconds
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Quality Criteria

- ✅ EXPLAIN plan analyzed for all queries
- ✅ Indexes created for all foreign keys
- ✅ No sequential scans on large tables
- ✅ Query execution time <100ms for simple queries
- ✅ Connection pooling configured
- ✅ Vacuum running automatically
- ✅ Backups automated and tested

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Query slow despite index
**Solution**: Check EXPLAIN plan, ensure index is being used, update table statistics with ANALYZE

**Issue**: Deadlocks occurring
**Solution**: Always acquire locks in the same order, use explicit locking with NOWAIT

**Issue**: Disk space growing rapidly
**Solution**: Run VACUUM, check for bloat, archive old data

## Core Principles

1. **Query Performance is Data Distribution Dependent**: The optimal query plan depends entirely on data distribution, cardinality, and statistics - not on abstract rules. A query that performs well with 1000 rows may fail catastrophically with 1 million rows. This means EXPLAIN ANALYZE is mandatory, not optional - you cannot optimize queries without understanding actual execution plans and row counts. Index selection depends on cardinality (high cardinality columns like email benefit from B-tree indexes, low cardinality like status may not), data skew (non-uniform distributions break planner assumptions), and correlation between columns (multi-column indexes work best when columns are queried together). Never apply generic optimization advice without analyzing the specific workload, data distribution, and EXPLAIN output for your database.

2. **Indexes are Not Free - They Have Costs and Trade-offs**: Every index speeds up reads but slows down writes, consumes disk space, and requires maintenance (vacuum, statistics updates). Over-indexing is as problematic as under-indexing. This requires thoughtful index design based on query patterns: create indexes for frequently queried columns with high cardinality, use covering indexes to eliminate table lookups for hot queries, implement partial indexes for filtered queries to reduce index size, and avoid redundant indexes (an index on (user_id, created_at) makes a separate index on (user_id) redundant in PostgreSQL). Monitor index usage with pg_stat_user_indexes and drop unused indexes. For write-heavy workloads, fewer indexes with higher query impact beats many indexes with marginal benefits.

3. **Transactions and Isolation Levels Must Match Business Requirements**: Transaction isolation levels (Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable) trade consistency for concurrency. The default (Read Committed in PostgreSQL) is not always correct - it allows non-repeatable reads and phantom reads. Financial transactions require Serializable isolation to prevent lost updates, reporting queries may accept Read Uncommitted for better performance, and most OLTP workloads work with Read Committed. Understanding isolation levels prevents subtle bugs like double-charging users or inventory overselling. This means explicitly setting isolation levels for critical transactions, using SELECT FOR UPDATE for pessimistic locking when needed, implementing optimistic locking with version columns for high-concurrency updates, and testing transaction behavior under concurrent load to verify isolation guarantees hold.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **SELECT * in Production Code** | Selecting all columns when only a few are needed wastes bandwidth, memory, and prevents covering indexes from working. If table schema changes (columns added), application code breaks silently or starts transferring unnecessary data. Large JSONB or TEXT columns in SELECT * can make queries 100x slower. | Explicitly select only needed columns: SELECT id, email, name FROM users WHERE id = $1. This enables covering indexes (index contains all selected columns, no table lookup needed), reduces network transfer, and makes schema changes explicit. For APIs, define specific result shapes with TypeScript interfaces or Pydantic models that map to explicit SELECT lists. |
| **Using OFFSET for Deep Pagination** | OFFSET forces database to scan and discard all skipped rows. Paginating to page 1000 with LIMIT 20 OFFSET 20000 requires scanning 20,020 rows, making deep pagination exponentially slower. This breaks user experience as users navigate to later pages and causes database load spikes. | Use cursor-based pagination with WHERE id > last_seen_id ORDER BY id LIMIT 20. This uses the index efficiently (seeks to starting point, no scanning skipped rows) and maintains constant performance regardless of page depth. For timestamp-based pagination, use WHERE created_at < last_timestamp ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20. Store cursor token (last ID or timestamp) in API response for next page. |
| **Ignoring Connection Pool Exhaustion** | Running out of database connections causes cascading failures where application servers queue requests, timeouts propagate, and service degrades catastrophically. Common causes: connections leaked (not released), pool sized too small for load, slow queries holding connections too long, or connection storms during traffic spikes. | Configure connection pools appropriately: pool size = (core_count * 2) + effective_spindle_count is a starting point. Monitor pool utilization (should be 60-80% under normal load). Implement connection timeouts and health checks. Use transaction-level pooling (PgBouncer in transaction mode) for microservices with bursty traffic. Add circuit breakers to prevent connection storms. Log slow queries holding connections >1 second. |
